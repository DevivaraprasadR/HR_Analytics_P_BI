# HR_Analytics_Power_BI

This project focuses on developing a Power BI dashboard tailored for in-depth analysis of employee attrition within the company.

To follow :
- In the given ".csv" file, remove the last row, since it has null values.
- Since there are a few duplicates in the data, before proceeding further perform "Delete Duplicates" on all the columns at once.
- Now, we are good to go with creating visualizations.
